## Education

B.S. in Biomedical Engineering with focus on Biomaterials and Molecular Engineering, Northwestern University

## Biography

Sabeen Admani is currently a student in the Master of Science in Robotics program at Northwestern University. Throughout her undergrad, she actively sought out opportunities to volunteer her skills and time towards various causes, serving eventually as a board member of the New Life Volunteering Society (NLVS) during her senior year. In this role, she was forging a connection for NU undergraduate students to be able to volunteer at weekly health screenings for the Compassionate Care Network, a non-profit healthcare organization that serves the Chicagoland area. Through her success in this role, she was eventually asked to become program director part-time for the Compassionate Care Network, performing her NLVS duties on a much larger scale.

Furthermore, her senior year, she worked on a project for Feinberg Medical Schoolâ€™s Simulation and Immersive Technology Lab under Dr. John Vozenilek. This project was a shoulder dislocation simulator that aimed to teach medical professionals how to properly perform a shoulder reduction and practice several times before they needed to perform this procedure on actual patients. The shoulder dislocation simulator that her team developed eventually went on to win the Daniel D. Mickelson Engineering First Prize in June 2012 and received second honorable mention in the NIH Debut Engineering Challenge in August 2012.

After graduation, she worked at Jump Trading Simulation and Education Center developing training devices for medical professionals. While there, she helped develop a Doppler ultrasound trainer for SIMnext (patent issued: 8,926,333) and pioneered the use of patient specific 3D printed models for planning of complex surgeries. This work was featured in Crain's Business Magazine as well as Peoria local news avenues. She's looking to use the knowledge and experience she receives from the MSR program to improve patient care and rehabilitation... and just do some really cool things!
