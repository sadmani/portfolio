## Overview
The goal of this project was to use the Baxter robot (research model) by [Rethink Robotics](http://www.rethinkrobotics.com/) to fill stockings for the MSR 2015 cohort- just in time for the Holidays! This project involved using ROS and Python to use the inverse kinematics server by Rethink, as well as perform tag tracking and object recognition tasks.

###Major steps involved:

1. Identification of the stocking (whose stocking is it and where is it located?)
2. Identification of the present associated with that stocking (which present belongs to that person?)
3. Search for the present amongst others on a table (can Baxter appropriately distinguish this present amongst others?)
4. Go back to the initial scanned stocking and release the present into it (can Baxter remember how to get to that "home" position?)
