## Overview
The goal of this project was to get the Baxter robot to stuff stockings for the MSR students. This involved a few major steps:

1. Identification of the stocking (whose stocking is it and where is it located?)
2. Identification of the present associated with that stocking (which present belongs to that person?)
3. Search for the present amongst others on a table (can Baxter appropriately distinguish this present amongst others?)
4. Go back to the initial scanned stocking and release the present into it (can Baxter remember how to get to that "home" position?)
