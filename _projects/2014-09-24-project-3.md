## Overview
The goal of this project is to a control an Arduino-based rover through an obstacle course with ROS by user input (Leap Motion, Joystick, keyboard, etc.) remotely by using robot web tools.

There are a few different milestones for this project:

1. Setting up Arduino and ROS communication through rosserial
2. Controlling the rover through keyboard input
3. Creating a rover teleop package
4. Interfacing with robot web tools
