## Overview
The goal of this project was to develop a tutorial for using the RPG Monocular Pose Estimator ROS package that was developed based on the following paper:

M. Faessler, E. Mueggler, K. Schwabe, D. Scaramuzza: A Monocular Pose Estimation System based on Infrared LEDs. IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), Hong Kong, 2014.

This involved a few major steps:

1. Using the ROS camera calibration package to calibrate the webcam you are given
2. Following the documentation for the package to try and getting the package running
3. Building some sort of 3D holder for your LEDs and calculate the transforms between them
4. Building a circuit for powering the LEDs
5. Fine-tuning parameters of the tracking algorithm
6. Building a ROS package to run a demo involving the control of the turtlesim using this package
