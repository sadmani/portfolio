## Overview
The goal of this project is to control a microcontroller-based rover through an obstacle course with ROS by user input (Leap Motion, Joystick, keyboard, etc.) remotely using a web interface.

In particular, this involved using rosserial for communication of the computer with the microcontroller. Next, I had to gain a base level knowledge of html/css in order to build a web interface to control the robot.

###Major steps involved:

1. Setting up microcontroller and ROS communication through rosserial
*..Write an Arduino sketch that is subscribed to a topic that will change the state of an LED when a particular letter is published to it

*..G
2. Controlling the rover through keyboard input
*..Need to 
3. Creating a rover teleop package
4. Interfacing with robot web tools
